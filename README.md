#  Color and Edge Analysis of Fabric using Python
This project shows how we can use Python to check the **colors** and **edges** in a fabric image. It uses OpenCV and Matplotlib to help understand the fabric structure and color.

## Steps Done in This Project

### üîπ Step 1: Load Fabric Image  
- Loaded the fabric image  
- Changed its color from BGR - RGB to retain correct color

### üîπ Step 2: Grayscale & Sharpening  
- Turned the image into grayscale (black and white)  
- Applied a sharpening filter to make the texture clearer

### üîπ Step 3: RGB Histogram  
- Checked how much red, green, and blue is present  
- This helps in checking fabric dyeing or color issues

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a raw histogram with no post-processing

### üîπ Step 4: Edge Detection (Canny Filter)  
- Found the edges in the fabric  
- Helpful for spotting threads, weave, or defects

## Why I Did This Project

This project is built to demonstrate practical image processing techniques in fabric inspection ‚Äî useful for both research and real-world textile quality control.

Fun Fact: This is my first real project and I am really excited to present it to the world!
